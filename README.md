# Find the Murderer

This is a simple project made with PUN2. There are 2 classes: Villagers and Murderer. A murderer is chosen between the players at the beginning. Villagers try to find the Murderer each day. Murderer kills a villager each night. Villagers win if they kill the Murderer. Murderer wins if there are 2 players left.
